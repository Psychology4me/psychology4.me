					confided to me during the course of my counselling. Email addresses, contact information,
					names, personal or medical data will not be disclosed without the explicit consent of the
					person concerned (except when legally required).
				</p>
				<p>My work is based on professional ethical guidelines as they apply generally to
					psychologists. The counselling services offered here are performed in the function of a
					psychologist. These are NOT psychotherapeutic services.
				</p>
				<p>Please bare in mind that the transmission of data over the Internet, including email

					parties. Proceed carefully when writing emails and possibly omit the disclosure of

				<h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
				<p><b>In Short:</b> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary

				</p>

					legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely

					<b>2. Performance of a Contract.</b> We may process your personal information when we
					believe it is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations to you, including providing
					our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with you.<br>
					<b>3. Legitimate Interests.</b> We may process your information when we believe it is
					reasonably necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do
					not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may

					4. Send users information about special offers and discounts on our products and services<br>

					your information without your consent, including, for example:
				</p>
				<ul style="${"font-size: 20px; font-weight: 500"}"><li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be
						obtained in a timely way
					</li>
					<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
					<li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
					<li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess,
						process, or settle an insurance claim
					</li>
					<li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin
					</li>
					<li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of
						financial abuse
					</li>
					<li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the
						availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for
						purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the
						laws of Canada or a province
					</li>
					<li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of
						the court relating to the production of records
					</li>
					<li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or
						profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information
						was produced

				<h2>Verification process</h2>
				<p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the

					require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you
					have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we
					may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you
					provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a
					communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may
					also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
				</p>
				<p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or
					authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional
					information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your
					identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
					additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
					fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon
					as we finish verifying you.

					or ask to restrict the processing of the information.

					may deny a request from an authorised agent that does not submit proof that they have been
					validly authorised to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
				</p>
				<p>You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your personal information to
					third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as
					feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request
					submission.

<h2>16. What&#39;s with Social Media?</h2>
<p>We maintain online presences within social networks and platforms in order to be able to communicate with the customers, interested parties and users active there and to inform them about our services. When accessing the respective networks and platforms, the terms and conditions and data processing guidelines of their respective operators apply.
  Unless otherwise stated in our data protection declaration, we process the data of users if they communicate with us within the social networks and platforms, e.g. write articles on our online presences or send us messages.</p>
<h2>17. Integration of third party services and content</h2>
<p>Within our online offer on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in the analysis, optimisation and economic operation of our online offer in the sense of Art. 6 Par. 1 lit. f. GDPR), we use content or service offers from third parties in order to integrate their content and services, such as videos or fonts (hereinafter uniformly referred to as “content”).</p>
<p>This always presupposes that the third-party providers of these contents are aware of the IP address of the users, as without the IP address they would not be able to send the contents to their browsers. The IP address is therefore necessary for the display of this content. We make every effort to use only such content whose respective providers use the IP address only to deliver the content. Third party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as “web beacons”) for statistical or marketing purposes. “Pixel tags” can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user’s device and may contain technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visiting time and other details about the use of our online offer, as well as being linked to such information from other sources.</p>
<h3>YouTube</h3>
<p>We integrate the videos of the “YouTube” platform of the provider Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. Privacy policy: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/, Opt-Out: https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated.</p>

<h2>18. What Analytics &amp; Hosting do you use?</h2>
<p>Our website uses Plausible Analytics to help us understand visitor trends and the effectiveness of our marketing outreach. We chose Plausible Analytics because it is a privacy-focused company and platform that eschews personally identifiable information in favor of anonymous aggregate data. See the Plausible Analytics
  <a href="${"https://plausible.io/data-policy"}" target="${"_blank"}" class="${"link-underlined"}" rel="${"noreferrer"}">Data Policy.</a></p>
<p>We, or our hosting provider, on the basis of our legitimate interests as defined in Art. 6 Par. 1 lit. f. GDPR process data about every access to the server on which this service is located (so-called server log files). The access data includes the name of the accessed website, file, date and time of access, transferred data volume, notification of successful access, browser type and version, the user’s operating system, referrer URL (the previously visited site), IP address and the requesting provider.</p>
  <p>For security reasons (e.g. to clarify misuse or fraud), log file information is stored for a maximum of 7 days and then deleted. Data whose further storage is required for evidence purposes are excluded from deletion until the respective incident has been finally clarified.</p></div></div></div></section>`;
